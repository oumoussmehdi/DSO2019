# DSO2019 Training 

Label Emmaüs offers an online marketplace of products renovated or created by the Emmaus movement. Its catalog is growing steadily. Adding an product to the catalog from reception to its descriptions (images, description, warehouse) is not an automated process and takes more and more time.

Finding a price and writing a description are not simple. It takes a lot time and experience to describe an item. Adding a product takes at least 40 minutes to go online. Many products stay on the site for a long time before finding a buyer. And increasing the catalog requires more and more storage space, which is not always available.

To the question "why my products do not sell", Label Emmaüs does not know the answer (except by the feeling of profession).

The goal is to predict the duration between placing an object online and selling it.

The data contains about 10,000 objects (with description, price, category, etc.). The duration is only known for a subset of products (the learning base).

It will be necessary to predict the duration for the products of the base of tests.

The target is categorized into 3 categories:

0 : between 0 and 10 days
1 : between 10 days and 60 days
2 : more than 60 days
Good luck to everyone!
